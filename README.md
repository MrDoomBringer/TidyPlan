# TidyPlan: CS321 Group #15

This is the codebase for TidyPlan, a time management system designed to help people smartly schedule their workdays.
This Django-based Web Application keeps track of a list of tasks and automatically segments a workday into time-periods to be spent driving progress on said tasks. It was developed as a final project for a Software Engineering class. 

This project exceeded all design requirements set by the professor and ourselves, and provided a great learning experience along the way to every member involved in its development!
